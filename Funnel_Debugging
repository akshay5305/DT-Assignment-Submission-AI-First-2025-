| Lead → MQL → SQL → Client | Response Rate | Drop-off Reason           | Campaign Summary                             |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 300 → 180 → 40 → 5        | 60%, then 22%  | Trust drop at SQL stage    | Emphasized product, lacked use-case clarity  |
| 250 → 60 → 12 → 2         | 24%, then 20%  | Weak CTA, no urgency       | Informative but non-committal                |
| 500 → 240 → 100 → 40      | 48%, then 41%  | Long-form, over-engineered | Message was too technical                    |
